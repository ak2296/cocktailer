# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Motivation on choosing frameworks/libraries ###

React is a easy learning vastly used library that offers a lot of opportunities to developers like making mobile apps with React Native or virtual reality website using React VR. In short it offers the developers a larger market than its competitors. React has a bigger community than the others which makes it a more reliable comparing to angular and Vue and others. This is because the larger community raises the possibility to fix issues may appear in the future faster and develop the library/framework to a better and more useful one. Factors like what mentioned above (and a lot more that can be piled up to become a book) and it bein straightforward, made the group to decide to use React for the project.
For a nicer look, fast and easy design and also to dig in the version 5 of the leading CSS framework the group decided to use Bootstrap 5 to decorate the Cocktailer. Less files to mess with, less problem!
